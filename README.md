# Tesla-Stock_prediction_final

### The goal of this project is to develop deep learning models (SimpleRNN and LSTM) to predict Tesla's stock

1. closing price using historical data.
2. Stock prices are sequential data, and RNNs (especially LSTMs) are well-suited for such time-series
forecasting problems.
3. We'll use 'Close' price as the target for our models and compare the prediction performance of RNN and
LSTM architectures.
